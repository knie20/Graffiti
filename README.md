### Architecture

The RadSideDrawer component is set up as an application starting point in:

- `/app-component.ts` - sets up the side drawer content and defines a page router outlet for the pages.

RadSideDrawer has the following component structure:

- `RadSideDrawer` - The component to display a drawer on the page.
- `tkDrawerContent` directive - Marks the component that will hold the drawer content.
- `tkMainContent` directive - Marks the component that will hold the app main content.

### Styling

This template is set up to use SASS for styling. All classes used are based on the {N} core theme â€“ consult the [documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/theme.html#theme) to understand how to customize it. Check it out to see what classes you can use on which component.

It has 4 global style files that are located at the root of the app folder:

- `_app-variables.scss` - holds the global SASS variables that are imported on each component's styles.
- `_app-common.scss` - the global common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `app.android.scss` - the global Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
- `app.ios.scss` - the global iOS style sheet. These style rules are applied to iOS only.
